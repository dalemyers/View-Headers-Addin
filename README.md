#View Headers Add-in

This is an [Office
Add-in](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj220060.aspx) for
viewing message headers in Outlook. 

##How do I install it?

Until I get around to submitting it to the store, here is what you do:

1. Go to <https://outlook.office.com/owa/#path=/options/manageapps>
2. Click the plus button at the top left of the list.
3. Select "Add from URL"
4. Paste the following URL in: <http://vel0x.github.io/View-Headers-Addin/manifest.xml>
5. Click "Next"
6. Click "Install"
7. Click "OK"
8. Now either wait for Outlook to resync, or restart Outlook.

When you click on a message, you should see the "View Headers" add-in in the
add-in bar.
